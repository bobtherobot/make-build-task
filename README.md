# make-build-task
For vscode - Sets up default build task by configuring "package.json" and "tasks.json" with a default build task. Allowing for quick setup for building your project with a keyboard shortcut While this sets things up for a javascript environment, ( npm node javascript ), the setup can easily be manually tweaked for others.
